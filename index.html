  <h1>Obodo Recipes</h1>
  <p>
    We love the grill for making simple seasonal meals. Grilling is such a quick and easy way to cook, with little mess, and the 'que adds flavor and texture to so many dishes we love. They're quick and easy recipes that keep things simple, with no hard-to-find ingredients or elaborate techniques. You may even learn a few basic grilling techniques along the way.
