  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Sausages marinate in beer with red bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, and red onions. String disks of sausage and pieces of veggies onto skewers and grill, melting provolone cheese over the top during the final few minutes of cooking. Bd.weld gives this recipe 5 stars: "Spicy good. I use shredded provolone hot Italian sausage and different colored peppers along with the jalapeno. These are really good with or without the provolone."
